PsyBots is a collaboration between Rebecca Stower and Benedikt Leichtmann intending to bring together interdisciplinary scientists in the field of human-robot interaction. It is a space to provide resources, share events, write blogs and connect with fellow PhD students and Early Career Researchers.

Rebecca is completing her PhD program at Jacobs University Bremen and is currently a visiting researcher at the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique at Sorbonne Université. She has a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours First Class) from the University of Queensland, Australia (2016). Her dissertation centres on the conceptualisation and measurement of children’s trust in robots, and in particular, the occurrence of robot errors during child-robot interactions. Outside of her research, she enjoys staying active with yoga and running, and sampling all the different kinds of cheese europe has to offer.

Benedikt is a Research Assistant at the LIT Robopsychology Lab Linz at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria. He has a Bachelor (2014) and Master of Science (2016) in Psychology from Ulm University. He then worked as research assistant and doctoral student in interdisciplinary teams with multiple industry and scientific partners at the Human Factors Institute at the Bundeswehr University Munich Germany and at the Institute of Industrial Engineering and Ergonomics at RWTH Aachen University Germany. His research mainly focuses on the psychological aspects of human-machine interaction such as robots and AI, with the goal of creating user-centered intercation designs and the socially acceptable implementation of new technology. He submitted his doctoral thesis in early 2021 on the social-psychological perspective on HRI at RWTH Aachen University Germany.
