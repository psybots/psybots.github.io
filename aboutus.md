PsyBots is a collaboration between Rebecca Stower and Benedikt Leichtmann intending to bring together interdisciplinary scientists in the filed of human-robot interaction. The pair met when Rebecca stalked Benedikt on twitter because he also wrote a meta-analysis. They quickly bonded over how terrible HRI researchers are at designing experiments and because both of them were the only psychologists in their respective teams.
