subtitle: Upcoming Conferences in HRI
---
On this page we describe the different kinds of conference publications and list some of the popular conferences in HRI. We have also included conferences which although do not focus on social robotics specifically, may contain tracks relevant to human robot interaction. 

Depending on your research background, you may or may not come from a field where submitting and publishing in conference venues is common. Thus, we present a brief explanation below of the different kinds of conference submissions. It is also important to note that, depending on the venue, conference submissions can sometimes have a higher impact factor than journal venues. So, it is useful to consider both conference and journal venues when deciding on an avenue in which to publish your work. 

### Full Papers 
These are papers which present fully developed work or findings, and are typically the longest submissions. They are almost always indexed (i.e., receive a DOI and are published in the proceedings) and thus count towards publications.

### Work in Progress / Late Breaking Reports
Whilst not all conferences have this track, it is becoming more common and is intended as a venue to present work which has not been fully developed. This can include descriptions of pilot studies, research paradigms, or systems which are still being developed and/or tested. Depending on the venue, these may also be indexed and published in the proceedings of the conference. 

### Doctoral Consortia
Doctoral Consortia are intended as a track for PhD candidates to submit and discuss their work. They can be particularly benefical for early-stage PhD candidates who may not yet have conducted experiments or are still in the planning phase of their research. 

### Workshop Proposals
Workshops are intended to focus on a specific topic within a conference (e.g., child-robot-interaction, robots for healthcare). Often, workshops will have their own paper submissions. Although these are not typically indexed/included in the conference proceedings, many workshops collaborate for Special Issues or Book chapters in which longer versions of the workshop papers can be submitted. 

## Upcoming Conferences
Below is a list of upcoming conferences and deadlines. We do not include all tracks for all conferences (e.g., some conferences also have design tracks or demos). Instead, we focus on the main types of submissions and deadlines. For more detailed info regarding the different types of submissions, acceptance notifications, and camera ready deadlines you can visit the linked conference website. Also due to the large number of workshops in each conference, we do not list all of them here. Instead, you can visit the conference website to check if the list of accepted workshops has been announced, and what the due dates are for submissions. 

Conferences are ordered by date, so conferences at the top of the list likely have already had most of their deadlines pass. We will try to update this page as regularly as possible as new conference dates and deadlines are announced. If you would like to see a conference added to the list, you can email us at psybots@gmail.com.
