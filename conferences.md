subtitle: Upcoming Conferences and Workshops in HRI

On this page we describe the different kinds of conference publications and list some of the popular conferences in HRI. We have also included conferences which although do not focus on social robotics specifically, may contain tracks relevant to human robot interaction. 

## Note for interdisciplinary researchers 
Depending on your research background, you may or may not come from a field where submitting and publishing in conference venues is common. Thus, we present a brief explanation below of the different kinds of conference submissions. It is also important to note that, depending on the venue, conference submissions (especially full papers) can have a higher impact factor than some journal venues. So, it is useful to consider both conference and journal venues when deciding on an avenue in which to publish your work. 

### Full Papers: 
These are papers which present fully developed work or findings, and are typically the longest submissions. They are almost always indexed (i.e., receive a DOI and are published in the proceedings) and thus count towards publications.

### Work in Progress / Late Breaking Reports: 
Whilst not all conferences have this track, it is becoming more common and is intended as a venue to present work which has not been fully developed. This can include descriptions of pilot studies, research paradigms, or systems which are still being developed and/or tested. Depending on the venue, these may also be indexed and published in the proceedings of the conference. 

### Doctoral Consortia: 
Doctoral Consortia are intended as a track for PhD candidates to submit and discuss their work. They can be particularly benefical for early-stage PhD candidates who may not yet have conducted experiments or are still in the planning phase of their research. 

### Workshop Proposals:
Workshops are intended to focus on a specific topic within a conference (e.g., child-robot-interaction, robots for healthcare). Often, workshops will have their own paper submissions. Although these are not typically indexed/included in the conference proceedings, many workshops collaborate for Special Issues or Book chapters in which longer versions of the workshop paper can be submitted. Due to the large number of workshops in each conference, we do not list all of them here. Instead, you can visit the conference website to check if the list of accepted workshops has been announced, and what the due dates are.
